# adb remount & dynamic partitions

## Overview

adb remount and dynamic partitions refer to mechanisms for modifying system partitions in Android development. `adb remount` allows remounting read-only partitions as read-write for development and debugging, while dynamic partitions provide flexible partition sizing and management for modern Android devices. Understanding adb remount and dynamic partitions is essential for AOSP development, as it explains how to modify system partitions, how dynamic partitions work, how to remount partitions, how dynamic partitions enable flexible sizing, and how these mechanisms support development and system updates. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of adb remount, dynamic partitions, partition management, remount operations, and development workflows.

Think of adb remount and dynamic partitions like flexible storage management: just as you can remount a USB drive as writable to modify files, and use dynamic disk partitioning to resize partitions as needed, adb remount allows you to make read-only system partitions writable for development, and dynamic partitions allow Android to flexibly manage partition sizes based on actual needs, rather than fixed sizes.

## Deep Explanation

### What are adb remount & Dynamic Partitions?

adb remount and dynamic partitions refer to mechanisms for modifying and managing system partitions in Android. adb remount enables read-write access to system partitions, while dynamic partitions provide flexible partition management.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Remount:** Remount partitions as read-write
- **Dynamic:** Flexible partition sizing
- **Development:** Development and debugging support
- **Flexible:** Flexible partition management
- **Modern:** Modern Android partition system

**Why adb remount & Dynamic Partitions?**
- **Development:** Enable system modification for development
- **Flexibility:** Flexible partition sizing
- **Updates:** Support system updates
- **Management:** Better partition management

### adb remount

#### Remount Overview

**adb remount:**
- Remounts system partitions as read-write
- Enables system file modification
- Development and debugging tool
- Requires root access

**Remount Characteristics:**
- Changes mount from read-only to read-write
- Enables file system modifications
- Development tool
- Root access required

#### Remount Process

**Remount Steps:**
```bash
# Enable root access
adb root

# Remount system partition
adb remount

# Verify remount
adb shell mount | grep system
```

**Remount Process:**
```
1. Enable root access (adb root)
2. Remount partition (adb remount)
3. Partition becomes read-write
4. Can modify system files
```

#### Remount Targets

**Remountable Partitions:**
- `/system` - System partition
- `/vendor` - Vendor partition
- `/product` - Product partition
- `/system_ext` - System extensions partition

**Remount Characteristics:**
- Multiple partitions can be remounted
- Each partition remounted separately
- Read-write access enabled
- Modifications possible

#### Remount Limitations

**Limitations:**
- Requires root access
- Requires unlocked bootloader (usually)
- SELinux may restrict access
- dm-verity may prevent modifications

**Limitation Details:**
- Root access required
- Bootloader unlock needed
- SELinux enforcement
- Verified boot restrictions

### Dynamic Partitions

#### Dynamic Partitions Overview

**Dynamic Partitions:**
- Logical partitions, not physical
- Flexible partition sizing
- Resizable partitions
- Better space utilization

**Dynamic Characteristics:**
- Logical partition groups
- Flexible sizing
- Resizable as needed
- Space efficient

#### Dynamic Partition Structure

**Partition Groups:**
```
system_a    - Logical partition in system_a group
system_b    - Logical partition in system_b group
vendor_a    - Logical partition in vendor_a group
vendor_b    - Logical partition in vendor_b group
```

**Group Structure:**
- Partition groups contain logical partitions
- Partitions can be resized
- Space shared within group
- Flexible allocation

#### Dynamic Partition Benefits

**Benefits:**
- Flexible partition sizing
- Better space utilization
- Supports A/B updates
- Easier partition management

**Benefit Details:**
- No fixed partition sizes
- Space used efficiently
- A/B update support
- Management flexibility

### Partition Management

#### Remount Operations

**Remount Commands:**
```bash
# Remount system as read-write
adb remount

# Remount specific partition
adb shell mount -o remount,rw /system

# Remount as read-only
adb shell mount -o remount,ro /system

# Check mount status
adb shell mount | grep system
```

**Operation Characteristics:**
- Remount to read-write
- Remount to read-only
- Check mount status
- Multiple partition support

#### Dynamic Partition Operations

**Dynamic Partition Commands:**
```bash
# List dynamic partitions
adb shell lpdump

# Resize partition
adb shell lpm resize <partition> <size>

# Check partition status
adb shell lpm get <partition>
```

**Operation Characteristics:**
- List partitions
- Resize partitions
- Check partition status
- Manage partition groups

### Development Workflows

#### System Modification Workflow

**Modification Process:**
```
1. Enable root access
   adb root

2. Remount system partition
   adb remount

3. Push modified files
   adb push file /system/path/

4. Set permissions
   adb shell chmod 644 /system/path/file

5. Reboot if needed
   adb reboot
```

**Workflow Characteristics:**
- Root access required
- Remount partition
- Push files
- Set permissions
- Reboot if necessary

#### Testing Workflow

**Testing Process:**
```
1. Remount partition

3. Test functionality
4. Revert if needed
5. Remount as read-only
```

**Workflow Characteristics:**
- Remount for testing
- Install test components
- Test functionality

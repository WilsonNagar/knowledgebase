# Security patches

## Overview

Security patches are updates to the Android system that fix security vulnerabilities, address security issues, and improve system security. Security patches are distributed through monthly security updates, critical security fixes, and system updates. Understanding security patches is essential for AOSP development, as it explains how security vulnerabilities are fixed, how security patches are created and distributed, how patches are applied, how patch levels are tracked, and how security patches maintain system security. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of security patches, patch types, patch creation, patch distribution, patch application, and patch management.

Think of security patches like security updates for a building: just as a building might receive security updates to fix vulnerabilities in its security systems (new locks, updated access controls, fixed security cameras), Android receives security patches to fix vulnerabilities in its security systems (fixed bugs, updated security policies, improved protections).

## Deep Explanation

### What are Security Patches?

Security patches are updates to the Android system that fix security vulnerabilities, address security issues, and improve system security. Security patches are distributed through monthly security updates, critical security fixes, and system updates.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Vulnerability Fixes:** Fix security vulnerabilities
- **Regular Updates:** Monthly security updates
- **Critical Fixes:** Critical security fixes
- **System Security:** Improve system security
- **Patch Levels:** Tracked by patch levels

**Why Security Patches?**

- **Assessments:** Security assessments

#### Patch Development

**Patch Development:**
- Develop fix for vulnerability
- Test fix thoroughly
- Review fix for security
- Validate fix effectiveness

**Development Process:**
```
1. Identify vulnerability
2. Develop fix
3. Test fix
4. Review fix
5. Validate fix
6. Prepare patch
```

#### Patch Testing

**Patch Testing:**
- Test patch thoroughly
- Verify fix works
- Check for regressions
- Validate security improvement

**Testing Process:**
- **Functional Testing:** Test functionality
- **Security Testing:** Test security
- **Regression Testing:** Check for regressions
- **Validation:** Validate effectiveness

### Security Patch Distribution

#### OTA Distribution

**OTA Distribution:**
- Distributed via OTA updates
- Signed update packages
- Verified before installation
- Secure distribution

**OTA Characteristics:**
- **Over-The-Air:** Wireless distribution
- **Signed:** Signed packages
- **Verified:** Verified before installation
- **Secure:** Secure distribution

#### Patch Package Format

**Patch Package Format:**
- ZIP file format
- Contains patch files
- Includes metadata
- Signed package

**Package Contents:**
- **Patch Files:** Modified files
- **Metadata:** Patch metadata
- **Instructions:** Installation instructions
- **Signature:** Package signature

### Security Patch Application

#### Patch Installation

**Patch Installation:**
- Download patch package
- Verify package signature
- Apply patch to system
- Reboot if needed

**Installation Process:**
```
1. Download patch package
2. Verify package signature
3. Apply patch to system
4. Verify patch application
5. Reboot if needed
```

#### Patch Verification

**Patch Verification:**
- Verify patch signature
- Check patch compatibility
- Validate patch application
- Confirm patch effectiveness

**Verification Steps:**
- **Signature:** Verify package signature
- **Compatibility:** Check compatibility
- **Application:** Validate application
- **Effectiveness:** Confirm effectiveness

### Security Patch Levels

#### Patch Level Concept

**Patch Level:**
- Tracks security patch version
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Indicates patch date
- Used for compliance

**Patch Level Format:**
```
Security patch level: 2024-12-01
Year: 2024
Month: 12
Day: 01
```

#### Patch Level Tracking

**Patch Level Tracking:**
- Stored in system properties
- Displayed in settings
- Used for compliance
- Tracks patch status

**Tracking Mechanism:**
- **System Property:** `ro.build.version.security_patch`
- **Settings Display:** Shown in settings
- **Compliance:** Used for compliance
- **Status:** Tracks patch status

### Security Patch Management

#### Patch Scheduling

**Patch Scheduling:**
- Monthly security updates
- Critical patches as needed
- Scheduled releases
- Coordinated distribution

**Scheduling Characteristics:**
- **Monthly:** Monthly updates
- **Critical:** Critical patches as needed
- **Scheduled:** Scheduled releases
- **Coordinated:** Coordinated distribution

#### Patch Prioritization

**Patch Prioritization:**
- Critical vulnerabilities first

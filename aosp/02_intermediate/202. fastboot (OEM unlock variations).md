# fastboot (OEM unlock variations)

## Overview

fastboot (OEM unlock variations) refers to the different methods and commands used to unlock Android device bootloaders across various manufacturers and device models. Understanding fastboot OEM unlock variations is essential for AOSP development, as it explains how to unlock bootloaders on different devices, what device-specific commands exist, what prerequisites are required, and how unlocking affects device security and functionality. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of fastboot OEM unlock variations, unlock methods, device-specific commands, prerequisites, consequences, and best practices.

Think of fastboot OEM unlock variations like different types of locks: just as different locks require different keys or unlocking methods (combination lock, key lock, electronic lock), different Android devices require different fastboot commands or tools to unlock their bootloaders. Each manufacturer implements bootloader unlocking differently, requiring device-specific knowledge and procedures.

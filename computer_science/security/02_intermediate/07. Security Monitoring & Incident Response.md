- **Investigation**: Investigate incidents
- **Escalation**: Escalate to Tier 3

**Tier 3**:
- **Expert Analysis**: Expert analysis
- **Threat Hunting**: Proactive hunting
- **Architecture**: Security architecture

## Threat Detection

### Detection Methods

**1. Signature-Based**:
```
Match known attack patterns
```

**2. Anomaly-Based**:
```
Detect deviations from normal
```

**3. Behavior-Based**:
```
Analyze behavior patterns
```

**4. Threat Intelligence**:
```
Use threat feeds
```

### Detection Techniques

**1. Log Analysis**:
```
Analyze logs for indicators
```

**2. Network Monitoring**:
```
Monitor network traffic
```

**3. Endpoint Monitoring**:
```
Monitor endpoints
```

**4. User Behavior Analytics**:
```
Analyze user behavior
```

## Incident Response Process

### Incident Response Lifecycle

**1. Preparation**:
```
Prepare for incidents
```

**2. Detection**:
```
Detect incidents
```

**3. Containment**:
```
Contain incidents
```

**4. Eradication**:
```
Remove threats
```

**5. Recovery**:
```
Recover systems
```

**6. Post-Incident**:
```
Learn from incidents
```

### Containment Strategies

**1. Short-Term Containment**:
```
Immediate containment
```

**2. Long-Term Containment**:
```
Sustained containment
```

**3. Isolation**:
```
Isolate affected systems
```

**4. Segmentation**:
```
Segment network
```

## Forensics

### Digital Forensics

**Forensics**: Investigate incidents

**Process**:
```
1. Collection: Collect evidence
2. Preservation: Preserve evidence
3. Analysis: Analyze evidence
4. Documentation: Document findings
```

### Evidence Collection

**1. Logs**:
```
System, application logs
```

**2. Memory**:
```
Memory dumps
```

**3. Disk Images**:
```
Disk images
```

**4. Network Traffic**:
```
Packet captures
```

### Chain of Custody

**Chain of Custody**: Document evidence handling

**Purpose**: Ensure evidence integrity

**Process**: 
```
Document who handled evidence
When, where, how
```

## Threat Intelligence

### What is Threat Intelligence?

**Threat Intelligence**: Information about threats

**Types**:
- **Strategic**: High-level trends
- **Tactical**: Attack techniques
- **Operational**: Specific threats
- **Technical**: Indicators of compromise

### Threat Intelligence Sources

**1. Commercial Feeds**:
```
Commercial threat feeds
```

**2. Open Source**:
```
Open-source intelligence
```

**3. Internal**:
```
Internal threat data
```

**4. Information Sharing**:
```
Share with community
```

### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

**IOCs**: Indicators of compromise

**Types**:
- **IP Addresses**: Malicious IPs
- **Domains**: Malicious domains
- **File Hashes**: Malicious files
- **URLs**: Malicious URLs

**Use**: Detect threats

## Best Practices

### Practice 1: Comprehensive Logging

**Log Everything**:
```
System events
Application events
Network events
User activities
```

**Benefit**: Better detection

### Practice 2: Continuous Monitoring

**24/7 Monitoring**:
```
Continuous surveillance
```

**Benefit**: Early detection

### Practice 3: Incident Response Plan

**Plan**:
```
Documented procedures
Roles and responsibilities
```

**Benefit**: Effective response

### Practice 4: Regular Testing

**Testing**:
```
Test incident response
Tabletop exercises
```

**Benefit**: Preparedness

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Data Breach Response

**Incident**: Data breach detected

**Response**:
1. Contain breach
2. Investigate scope
3. Notify affected
4. Remediate vulnerabilities
5. Post-incident review

### Example 2: Ransomware Attack

**Incident**: Ransomware detected

**Response**:
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Assess damage
3. Restore from backups
4. Investigate entry point
5. Strengthen defenses

## Common Pitfalls

### Problem: Alert Fatigue

```c
// BAD: Too many false positives
// Analysts ignore alerts

// GOOD: Tune detection
// Reduce false positives
```

### Problem: Inadequate Logging

```c
// BAD: Insufficient logs
// Can't investigate incidents

// GOOD: Comprehensive logging
// Log all relevant events
```

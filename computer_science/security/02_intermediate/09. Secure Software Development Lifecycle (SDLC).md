## What is Secure SDLC?

### Definition

**Secure SDLC**: Security integrated in SDLC

**Secure SDLC**: Security throughout lifecycle

**Benefit**: Build security in, not bolt on

### Secure SDLC Phases

**1. Requirements**:
```
Security requirements
```

**2. Design**:
```
Secure design
Threat modeling
```

**3. Development**:
```
Secure coding
Code review
```

**4. Testing**:
```
Security testing
```

**5. Deployment**:
```
Secure deployment
```

**6. Maintenance**:
```
Security updates
```

## Security Requirements

### Security Requirements Types

**1. Functional Requirements**:
```
What security features needed
```

**2. Non-Functional Requirements**:
```
Security properties
```

**3. Compliance Requirements**:
```
Regulatory compliance
```

**4. Threat Requirements**:
```
Threats to address
```

### Security Requirements Examples

**Authentication**:
```
Users must authenticate
Multi-factor authentication
```

**Authorization**:
```
Role-based access control
Least privilege
```

**Data Protection**:
```
Encryption at rest
Encryption in transit
```

**Audit**:
```
Log security events
Audit trail
```

## Threat Modeling

### What is Threat Modeling?

**Threat Modeling**: Identify threats

**Purpose**: Understand threats

**Method**: Systematic analysis

**Benefit**: Design secure systems

### Threat Modeling Process

**1. Identify Assets**:
```
What to protect
```

**2. Identify Threats**:
```
What threats exist
```

**3. Identify Vulnerabilities**:
```
What vulnerabilities exist
```

**4. Assess Risk**:
```
Risk assessment
```

**5. Mitigate**:
```
Design mitigations
```

### STRIDE Model

**STRIDE**: Threat categories

- **S**poofing: Impersonation
- **T**ampering: Data modification
- **R**epudiation: Deny actions
- **I**nformation Disclosure: Data exposure
- **D**enial of Service: Availability
- **E**levation of Privilege: Unauthorized access

## Secure Design

### Security Design Principles

**1. Defense in Depth**:
```
Multiple layers of defense
```

**2. Least Privilege**:
```
Minimal permissions
```

**3. Fail Secure**:
```
Fail securely
```

**4. Separation of Duties**:
```
Separate responsibilities
```

**5. Economy of Mechanism**:
```
Keep it simple
```

### Secure Architecture Patterns

**1. Zero Trust**:
```
Never trust, always verify
```

**2. Microservices Security**:
```
Secure microservices
```

**3. API Security**:
```
Secure APIs
```

**4. Container Security**:
```
Secure containers
```

## Secure Coding

### Secure Coding Practices

**1. Input Validation**:
```
Validate all input
```

**2. Output Encoding**:
```
Encode output
```

**3. Authentication**:
```
Strong authentication
```

**4. Authorization**:
```
Check authorization
```

**5. Cryptography**:
```
Use strong cryptography
```

**6. Error Handling**:
```
Secure error handling
```

**7. Logging**:
```
Security logging
```

### Code Review

**Security Code Review**:
```
Review for security issues
```

**Checklist**:
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Cryptography
- Error handling

## Security Testing

### Security Testing Types

**1. Static Analysis (SAST)**:
```
Analyze source code
```

**2. Dynamic Analysis (DAST)**:
```
Test running application
```

**3. Interactive Analysis (IAST)**:
```
Runtime analysis
```

**4. Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**:
```
Analyze dependencies
```

### Security Testing Tools

**SAST Tools**:
- **SonarQube**: Code analysis
- **Checkmarx**: Commercial SAST
- **Veracode**: Commercial SAST

**DAST Tools**:
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web scanner
- **Burp Suite**: Web security testing
- **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanner

## Security Deployment

### Secure Deployment Practices

**1. Secure Configuration**:
```
Secure defaults
```

**2. Secrets Management**:
```
Manage secrets securely
```

**3. Patch Management**:
```
Keep systems patched
```

**4. Monitoring**:
```
Security monitoring
```

**5. Incident Response**:
```
Incident response plan
```

### Container Security

**Container Security**:
- **Image Scanning**: Scan images
- **Runtime Security**: Runtime protection
- **Secrets**: Manage secrets
- **Network**: Network security

## DevSecOps

### What is DevSecOps?

**DevSecOps**: Security in DevOps

**Goal**: Integrate security in CI/CD

**Benefit**: Continuous security

### DevSecOps Practices

**1. Shift Left**:
```
Security early in lifecycle
```

**2. Automation**:
```
Automate security testing
```

**3. Continuous Security**:
```
Continuous security checks
```

**4. Collaboration**:
```
Security + Development
```

### CI/CD Security

**Security in CI/CD**:
- **SAST**: In build pipeline
- **DAST**: In test pipeline
- **SCA**: Dependency scanning
- **Secrets Scanning**: Scan for secrets

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Banking Application

**Security Requirements**:
- Strong authentication
- Encryption
- Audit logging

**Threat Modeling**:
- Identify threats
- Design mitigations

**Security Testing**:
- SAST, DAST
- Penetration testing

### Example 2: E-Commerce Platform

**Security Requirements**:
- PCI DSS compliance
- Secure payment
- Data protection

**Secure Design**:
- Secure architecture
- API security

**Security Testing**:
- Continuous testing

## Common Pitfalls

### Problem: Security as Afterthought

```c
// BAD: Add security at end
// Expensive, ineffective

// GOOD: Security from start
// Build security in
```

### Problem: Inadequate Testing

```c
// BAD: Only functional testing
// Miss security issues

// GOOD: Security testing
// SAST, DAST, penetration testing
```

# Network Security

## Overview

Network security protects network infrastructure and data in transit. Understanding firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, VPNs, and network security protocols is essential for securing networks and protecting against attacks.

## Network Security Overview

### Threats

**1. Unauthorized Access**:
```
Attackers gaining network access
```

**2. Data Interception**:
```
Eavesdropping on network traffic
```

**3. Denial of Service**:
```
Overwhelming network resources
```

**4. Malware**:
```
Viruses, worms, trojans
```

**5. Man-in-the-Middle**:
```
Intercepting and modifying traffic
```

### Defense Strategies

**1. Perimeter Defense**:
```
Firewalls at network boundary
```

**2. Network Monitoring**:
```
IDS/IPS for detection/prevention
```

**3. Encryption**:
```
Encrypt data in transit
```

**4. Segmentation**:
```
Isolate network segments
```

## Firewalls

### What is a Firewall?

**Firewall**: Network security device

**Purpose**: Control incoming/outgoing traffic

**Method**: Rules-based filtering

**Types**: Packet filtering, stateful, application-layer

### Packet Filtering Firewall

**Method**: Inspect packet headers

**Criteria**: 
- **Source IP**: Where packet from
- **Destination IP**: Where packet going
- **Port**: Which port
- **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, ICMP

**Decision**: Allow or deny

**Limitation**: No context awareness

### Stateful Firewall

**Method**: Track connection state

**Process**:
```
1. Track connection establishment
2. Allow return traffic for established connections
3. More intelligent than packet filtering
```

**Benefit**: Better security, less restrictive

### Application-Layer Firewall

**Method**: Inspect application data

**Process**:
```
1. Deep packet inspection
2. Understand application protocols
3. Filter based on application content
```

**Benefit**: More granular control

**Use**: Web application firewalls (WAF)

## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

### What is IDS?

**IDS**: Intrusion Detection System

**Purpose**: Detect suspicious activity

**Method**: Monitor network traffic

**Action**: Alert (doesn't block)

**Types**: Network-based (NIDS), Host-based (HIDS)

### IDS Detection Methods

**1. Signature-Based**:
```
Match known attack patterns
```

**2. Anomaly-Based**:
```
Detect deviations from normal
```

**3. Behavior-Based**:
```
Analyze behavior patterns
```

### IDS Limitations

**1. False Positives**:
```
Alert on legitimate traffic
```

**2. False Negatives**:
```
Miss actual attacks
```

**3. Performance**:
```
May impact network performance
```

## Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

### What is IPS?

**IPS**: Intrusion Prevention System

**Purpose**: Detect and prevent attacks

**Method**: Monitor and block

**Action**: Block suspicious traffic

**Difference**: IPS blocks, IDS only alerts

### IPS Types

**1. Network-Based (NIPS)**:
```
Monitor network traffic
Block at network level
```

**2. Host-Based (HIPS)**:
```
Monitor host activity
Block at host level
```

**3. Inline IPS**:
```
In traffic path
Can block immediately
```

## Virtual Private Networks (VPN)

### What is VPN?

**VPN**: Virtual Private Network

**Purpose**: Secure remote access

**Method**: Encrypted tunnel

**Use**: Remote access, site-to-site

### VPN Types

**1. Site-to-Site VPN**:
```
Connect networks
```

**2. Remote Access VPN**:
```
Connect remote users
```

**3. SSL VPN**:
```
Browser-based VPN
```

### VPN Protocols

**1. IPsec**:
```
Network layer encryption
```

**2. SSL/TLS**:
```
Application layer encryption
```

**3. OpenVPN**:
```
Open source VPN
```

## Network Segmentation

### What is Segmentation?

**Segmentation**: Divide network into segments

**Purpose**: Limit attack scope

**Method**: VLANs, firewalls between segments

**Benefit**: Isolate breaches

### Segmentation Strategy

**1. DMZ**:
```
Demilitarized zone
Public-facing servers
```

**2. Internal Networks**:
```
Private networks
Restricted access
```

**3. Guest Networks**:
```
Isolated guest access
```

## DDoS Protection

### What is DDoS?

**DDoS**: Distributed Denial of Service

**Attack**: Overwhelm target with traffic

**Source**: Multiple compromised systems

**Goal**: Make service unavailable

### DDoS Protection

**1. Rate Limiting**:
```
Limit request rate
```

**2. Filtering**:
```
Filter malicious traffic
```

**3. Scrubbing**:
```
Clean traffic before delivery
```

**4. CDN**:
```
Distribute load
```

## Best Practices

### Network Security Best Practices

**1. Defense in Depth**:
```
Multiple layers of security
```

**2. Least Privilege**:
```
Minimum necessary access
```

**3. Monitoring**:
```
Monitor network continuously
```

**4. Updates**:
```
Keep systems updated
```

**5. Encryption**:
```
Encrypt sensitive traffic
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Enterprise Network

**Components**:
- **Firewall**: Perimeter defense
- **IDS/IPS**: Intrusion detection/prevention
- **VPN**: Remote access
- **Segmentation**: Isolated segments

### Example 2: Cloud Security

**Components**:
- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls
- **Network ACLs**: Additional filtering
- **VPN**: Site-to-site connections
- **DDoS Protection**: Cloud provider protection

## Common Pitfalls

### Problem: Overly Permissive Rules

```bash
# BAD: Allow all traffic
iptables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT  # Too permissive!

# GOOD: Default deny, allow specific
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```

### Problem: Not Monitoring

```bash
# BAD: No monitoring
# Attacks go undetected

# GOOD: Monitor network
# Use IDS/IPS, log analysis
```

## Quiz

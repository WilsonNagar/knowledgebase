## Graph Properties

### Connectivity

**Connected Graph**: Path exists between any two vertices

**Disconnected**: Multiple components

**Strongly Connected** (Directed): Path in both directions between any two vertices

### Graph Metrics

**1. Degree**:
```
Number of edges incident to vertex
```

**2. Path Length**:
```
Number of edges in path
```

**3. Diameter**:
```
Longest shortest path between any two vertices
```

**4. Clustering Coefficient**:
```
Measure of how vertices cluster together
```

## Graph Representations

### Adjacency List

**Structure**: List of neighbors for each vertex

**Space**: O(V + E)

**Lookup**: O(degree(v))

**Use**: Sparse graphs

### Adjacency Matrix

**Structure**: Matrix with edges

**Space**: O(V²)

**Lookup**: O(1)

**Use**: Dense graphs, need fast lookups

## Graph Traversal Advanced

### BFS Applications

**1. Shortest Path** (Unweighted):
```
BFS finds shortest path
Level = distance
```

**2. Level Order**:
```
Process level by level
```

### DFS Applications

**1. Topological Sort**:
```
Order vertices such that edges go forward
Use: Dependency resolution
```

**2. Cycle Detection**:
```
Detect cycles in graph
```

**3. Strongly Connected Components**:
```
Find SCCs using DFS
```

## Minimum Spanning Trees

### What is MST?

**MST**: Minimum Spanning Tree

**Definition**: Tree connecting all vertices with minimum total weight

**Properties**: 
- **Acyclic**: No cycles
- **Connected**: All vertices reachable
- **Minimum**: Minimum total weight

### MST Algorithms

**1. Kruskal's Algorithm**:
```
1. Sort edges by weight
2. Add edges (avoid cycles)
3. Use union-find to detect cycles
```

**2. Prim's Algorithm**:
```
1. Start with any vertex
2. Add minimum edge from tree to outside
3. Repeat until all vertices included
```

### Kruskal's Example

**Graph**:
```
A --3-- B
| \     |
1   4   2
|     \ |
C --5-- D
```

**MST**:
```
A --1-- C
B --2-- D
A --3-- B
Total weight: 6
```

## Network Flows

### What are Network Flows?

**Flow Network**: Directed graph with capacities

**Source**: Produces flow

**Sink**: Consumes flow

**Capacity**: Maximum flow on edge

### Max Flow Problem

**Goal**: Find maximum flow from source to sink

**Algorithms**:
- **Ford-Fulkerson**: Augmenting paths
- **Edmonds-Karp**: BFS for augmenting paths
- **Dinic's**: More efficient

### Max Flow Example

**Network**:
```
Source --10--> A --5--> Sink
Source --5--> B --10--> Sink
A --3--> B
```

**Max Flow**: 15 (10 from A, 5 from B)

## Graph Coloring

### What is Graph Coloring?

**Graph Coloring**: Assign colors to vertices

**Constraint**: Adjacent vertices different colors

**Goal**: Minimize number of colors

### Chromatic Number

**Chromatic Number**: Minimum colors needed

**Bipartite Graph**: Chromatic number = 2

**Complete Graph**: Chromatic number = n

### Coloring Algorithms

**1. Greedy Coloring**:
```
Color vertices one by one
Use smallest available color
```

**2. Backtracking**:
```
Try all colorings
Find optimal
```

## Strongly Connected Components

### What are SCCs?

**SCC**: Strongly Connected Component

**Definition**: Maximal set where all vertices reachable from each other

### SCC Algorithm (Kosaraju's)

**Process**:
```
1. DFS to get finish times
2. Reverse graph
3. DFS in reverse order of finish times
4. Each DFS tree is SCC
```

## Applications

### Application 1: Social Networks

**Graph**: Users = vertices, Friendships = edges

**Analysis**: 
- **Communities**: Find clusters
- **Influence**: Centrality measures
- **Spread**: Information diffusion

### Application 2: Web Graph

**Graph**: Pages = vertices, Links = edges

**Analysis**:
- **PageRank**: Importance ranking
- **Crawling**: Traverse graph
- **Search**: Find relevant pages

### Application 3: Dependency Graphs

**Graph**: Tasks = vertices, Dependencies = edges

**Analysis**:
- **Topological Sort**: Execution order
- **Critical Path**: Longest path
- **Scheduling**: Optimize schedule

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: PageRank

**Algorithm**: Random walk on web graph

**Result**: Importance score for each page

**Use**: Google search ranking

### Example 2: Shortest Path Routing

**Problem**: Route packets in network

**Solution**: Dijkstra's or A* algorithm

**Use**: Internet routing

## Common Pitfalls

### Problem: Not Handling Cycles

```c
// BAD: Assume acyclic graph
// May get stuck in cycle

// GOOD: Track visited vertices
bool visited[MAX_VERTICES];
```

### Problem: Wrong Graph Representation

```c
// BAD: Use adjacency matrix for sparse graph
// Wastes space O(V²)

// GOOD: Use adjacency list for sparse graphs
// Space O(V + E)
```

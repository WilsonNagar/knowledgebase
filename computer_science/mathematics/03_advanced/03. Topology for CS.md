## What is Topology?

### Definition

**Topology**: Study of shape properties

**Focus**: Properties preserved under continuous deformation

**Concepts**: 
- **Open Sets**: Basic building blocks
- **Continuity**: Continuous functions
- **Compactness**: Bounded and closed
- **Connectedness**: Single piece

**Use**: Analysis, geometry, CS

### Topology vs Geometry

**Geometry**: 
```
Rigid shapes, distances
```

**Topology**: 
```
Flexible shapes, connectivity
```

**Analogy**: 
```
Coffee cup ≈ Donut (topologically)
Different (geometrically)
```

## Topological Spaces

### What is a Topological Space?

**Topological Space**: Set with topology

**Topology**: Collection of open sets

**Axioms**: 
1. **Empty set and whole set**: Open
2. **Union of opens**: Open
3. **Intersection of finitely many opens**: Open

**Use**: Generalize continuity

### Examples

**1. Euclidean Topology**:
```
Open intervals
```

**2. Discrete Topology**:
```
All subsets open
```

**3. Indiscrete Topology**:
```
Only empty and whole set open
```

**4. Network Topology**:
```
Network connectivity
```

## Continuity

### What is Continuity?

**Continuity**: Preserves open sets

**Definition**: 
```
f continuous if f⁻¹(open) is open
```

**Intuition**: 
```
Small changes → small changes
```

**Use**: Function analysis

### Continuous Functions

**Properties**: 
- **Composition**: Composition continuous
- **Sum/Product**: Sum/product continuous
- **Inverse**: Inverse may not be continuous

**Use**: Analysis, optimization

## Compactness

### What is Compactness?

**Compactness**: Every open cover has finite subcover

**Properties**: 
- **Closed and Bounded**: In ℝⁿ
- **Heine-Borel**: Equivalent in ℝⁿ
- **Preserved**: Under continuous maps

**Use**: Optimization, analysis

### Compactness Example

**Example**: 
```
[0,1] is compact
(0,1) is not compact
```

**Use**: Guarantee optima exist

## Connectedness

### What is Connectedness?

**Connected**: Cannot be separated

**Definition**: 
```
No non-empty open sets U, V
with U ∪ V = X, U ∩ V = ∅
```

**Path-Connected**: 
```
Any two points connected by path
```

**Use**: Network analysis

### Connectedness Example

**Example**: 
```
Interval [0,1]: Connected
Two disjoint intervals: Not connected
```

**Use**: Analyze connectivity

## Network Topology

### Network Topology Concepts

**Network Topology**: Structure of network

**Properties**: 
- **Connectivity**: Paths between nodes
- **Clustering**: Dense subgraphs
- **Centrality**: Important nodes
- **Robustness**: Resilience to failures

**Use**: Network analysis, design

### Topological Properties

**1. Connectedness**:
```
Network connectivity
```

**2. Compactness**:
```
Finite networks
```

**3. Homology**:
```
Holes, cycles
```

**4. Persistence**:
```
Persistent homology
```

## Applications in CS

### Application 1: Distributed Systems

**Use**: Analyze system topology

**Concepts**: 
- **Connectedness**: System connectivity
- **Robustness**: Failure resilience
- **Partitions**: Network partitions

**Result**: System analysis

### Application 2: Data Analysis

**Use**: Topological data analysis

**Method**: 
- **Persistent Homology**: Detect features
- **Topological Features**: Holes, cycles
- **Visualization**: Visualize structure

**Result**: Data insights

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Network Analysis

**Use**: Analyze network structure

**Topology**: 
- **Graph**: Network graph
- **Connectedness**: Connectivity
- **Centrality**: Important nodes

**Result**: Network understanding

### Example 2: Sensor Networks

**Use**: Sensor network design

**Topology**: 
- **Coverage**: Area coverage
- **Connectivity**: Network connectivity
- **Robustness**: Failure resilience

**Result**: Robust network

## Common Pitfalls

### Problem: Confusing Topology

```c
// BAD: Confuse with network topology
// Different concepts

// GOOD: Understand mathematical topology
// Apply to networks
```

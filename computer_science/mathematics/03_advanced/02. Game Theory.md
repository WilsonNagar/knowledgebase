# Game Theory

## Overview

Game theory studies strategic decision-making in competitive situations. Understanding Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies, zero-sum games, and mechanism design is essential for economics, AI, networking, and algorithm design.

## What is Game Theory?

### Definition

**Game Theory**: Study of strategic decisions

**Components**: 
- **Players**: Decision makers
- **Strategies**: Available actions
- **Payoffs**: Outcomes/utilities
- **Equilibrium**: Stable outcomes

**Use**: Economics, AI, networking, CS

### Game Theory Applications

**1. Economics**:
```
Market behavior, auctions
```

**2. AI**:
```
Multi-agent systems
```

**3. Networking**:
```
Routing, congestion control
```

**4. Algorithm Design**:
```
Mechanism design
```

## Game Types

### Classification

**1. Cooperative vs Non-Cooperative**:
```
Cooperation allowed or not
```

**2. Zero-Sum vs Non-Zero-Sum**:
```
Sum of payoffs constant or not
```

**3. Simultaneous vs Sequential**:
```
Moves simultaneous or sequential
```

**4. Perfect vs Imperfect Information**:
```
Full information or not
```

### Example: Prisoner's Dilemma

**Game**: 
```
        Cooperate  Defect
Cooperate  (3,3)   (0,5)
Defect     (5,0)   (1,1)
```

**Nash Equilibrium**: (Defect, Defect)

**Paradox**: Both defect despite better outcome if cooperate

## Nash Equilibrium

### What is Nash Equilibrium?

**Nash Equilibrium**: Stable strategy profile

**Definition**: 
```
No player can improve by unilaterally changing
```

**Properties**: 
- **Stable**: No incentive to deviate
- **May not be optimal**: Not necessarily best outcome
- **May not be unique**: Multiple equilibria possible

**Use**: Predict game outcomes

### Finding Nash Equilibrium

**Method**: 
```
1. Check each strategy profile
2. See if any player wants to deviate
3. If no deviation: Nash equilibrium
```

**Example**: 
```
(Defect, Defect) in Prisoner's Dilemma
Neither player benefits from changing
```

## Dominant Strategies

### What are Dominant Strategies?

**Dominant Strategy**: Best regardless of others

**Definition**: 
```
Strategy that gives best payoff
regardless of opponent's strategy
```

**Strictly Dominant**: Always better

**Weakly Dominant**: At least as good

**Use**: Simplify analysis

### Dominant Strategy Example

**Example**: 
```
In Prisoner's Dilemma:
Defect dominates Cooperate
(5 > 3 and 1 > 0)
```

**Result**: Both players defect

## Zero-Sum Games

### What are Zero-Sum Games?

**Zero-Sum Game**: 
```
Sum of payoffs = 0
One player's gain = other's loss
```

**Examples**: 
- **Chess**: Win/loss
- **Poker**: Money transfers
- **Competition**: Winner takes all

**Analysis**: Minimax theorem

### Minimax Theorem

**Minimax**: 
```
Maximize minimum payoff
```

**Minimax Theorem**: 
```
In zero-sum games:
Minimax = Maximin = Value
```

**Use**: Find optimal strategies

## Mechanism Design

### What is Mechanism Design?

**Mechanism Design**: Design games

**Goal**: 
```
Design rules to achieve desired outcome
```

**Properties**: 
- **Incentive Compatible**: Truth-telling optimal
- **Individually Rational**: Participation beneficial
- **Efficient**: Optimal allocation

**Use**: Auctions, voting, matching

### Mechanism Design Example

**Example**: Vickrey Auction

**Mechanism**: 
```
1. Bidders submit bids
2. Highest bidder wins
3. Pays second-highest bid
```

**Property**: Truth-telling optimal

## Auctions

### Auction Types

**1. English Auction**:
```
Ascending bids
```

**2. Dutch Auction**:
```
Descending price
```

**3. First-Price Sealed-Bid**:
```
Highest bid wins, pays bid
```

**4. Vickrey (Second-Price)**:
```
Highest bid wins, pays second-highest
```

### Auction Properties

**Vickrey Auction**: 
- **Truth-Telling**: Optimal to bid true value
- **Efficient**: Highest value wins
- **Revenue**: Expected revenue

**Use**: Spectrum auctions, ad auctions

## Applications

### Application 1: Ad Auctions

**Use**: Online advertising

**Mechanism**: 
- **Vickrey-Clarke-Groves**: Generalized Vickrey
- **Truth-Telling**: Bidders bid true value
- **Efficient**: Optimal allocation

**Result**: Ad placement

### Application 2: Routing

**Use**: Network routing

**Game**: 
- **Players**: Routers
- **Strategies**: Routes
- **Payoffs**: Latency, cost

**Equilibrium**: Stable routing

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Spectrum Auctions

**Use**: Allocate spectrum

**Mechanism**: Vickrey auction

**Properties**: 
- **Efficient**: Optimal allocation
- **Revenue**: Maximize revenue
- **Fair**: Fair process

**Result**: Spectrum allocation

### Example 2: Multi-Agent AI

**Use**: Multi-agent systems

**Game Theory**: 
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Stable strategies
- **Learning**: Learn equilibria
- **Cooperation**: Cooperative games

**Result**: Coordinated agents

## Common Pitfalls

### Problem: Assuming Rationality

```c
// BAD: Assume perfect rationality
// May not match reality

// GOOD: Consider bounded rationality
// More realistic models
```

## Quiz

1. What is Nash equilibrium?
   - **A)** Optimal outcome
   - **B)** Strategy profile where no player benefits from unilaterally changing
   - **C)** Best strategy
   - **D)** Random strategy

2. What is a zero-sum game?
   - **A)** Cooperative game
   - **B)** Game where sum of payoffs is zero (one's gain = other's loss)
   - **C)** Non-competitive game
   - **D)** Team game

3. What is mechanism design?
   - **A)** Game analysis
   - **B)** Designing game rules to achieve desired outcomes
   - **C)** Playing games
   - **D)** Game simulation

**Answers:**
1. **B** - Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing strategy
2. **B** - Zero-sum games have constant sum of payoffs (often zero), meaning one player's gain equals another's loss
3. **B** - Mechanism design creates game rules (mechanisms) to achieve desired outcomes like efficiency and truth-telling

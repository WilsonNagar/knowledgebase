## Sets & Set Theory

### What is a Set?

**Set**: Collection of distinct objects

**Notation**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

**Elements**: Objects in set

**Cardinality**: Number of elements |A|

### Set Operations

**Union** (A ∪ B):
```
A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}

Example:
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}
A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

**Intersection** (A ∩ B):
```
A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

Example:
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}
A ∩ B = {3}
```

**Difference** (A - B):
```
A - B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}

Example:
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}
A - B = {1, 2}
```

**Complement** (A'):
```
A' = {x | x ∈ U and x ∉ A}
(U = universal set)
```

### Set Properties

**Commutative**:
```
A ∪ B = B ∪ A
A ∩ B = B ∩ A
```

**Associative**:
```
(A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)
(A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C)
```

**Distributive**:
```
A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)
```

## Logic & Propositional Logic

### Propositions

**Proposition**: Statement that is true or false

**Examples**:
- "2 + 2 = 4" (True)
- "It is raining" (True or False)
- "x > 5" (Not a proposition, depends on x)

### Logical Operators

**NOT** (¬):
```
¬P: True if P is false
```

**AND** (∧):
```
P ∧ Q: True if both P and Q are true
```

**OR** (∨):
```
P ∨ Q: True if at least one is true
```

**IMPLIES** (→):
```
P → Q: False only if P true and Q false
```

**IFF** (↔):
```
P ↔ Q: True if P and Q have same truth value
```

### Truth Tables

**AND**:
```
P  Q  P∧Q
T  T   T
T  F   F
F  T   F
F  F   F
```

**OR**:
```
P  Q  P∨Q
T  T   T
T  F   T
F  T   T
F  F   F
```

**IMPLIES**:
```
P  Q  P→Q
T  T   T
T  F   F
F  T   T
F  F   T
```

### Logical Equivalences

**De Morgan's Laws**:
```
¬(P ∧ Q) ≡ ¬P ∨ ¬Q
¬(P ∨ Q) ≡ ¬P ∧ ¬Q
```

**Distributive**:
```
P ∧ (Q ∨ R) ≡ (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)
P ∨ (Q ∧ R) ≡ (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)
```

## Functions & Relations

### Functions

**Function**: Mapping from domain to codomain

**Notation**: f: A → B

**Properties**:
- **Injective** (one-to-one): f(a) = f(b) → a = b
- **Surjective** (onto): For all b ∈ B, exists a ∈ A: f(a) = b
- **Bijective**: Both injective and surjective

### Relations

**Relation**: Set of ordered pairs

**Properties**:
- **Reflexive**: (a, a) ∈ R for all a
- **Symmetric**: (a, b) ∈ R → (b, a) ∈ R
- **Transitive**: (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R → (a, c) ∈ R
- **Equivalence**: Reflexive, symmetric, transitive

## Graph Theory Basics

### What is a Graph?

**Graph**: G = (V, E)
- **V**: Set of vertices (nodes)
- **E**: Set of edges (connections)

**Types**:
- **Directed**: Edges have direction
- **Undirected**: Edges have no direction
- **Weighted**: Edges have weights

### Graph Terminology

**Degree**: Number of edges incident to vertex

**Path**: Sequence of vertices connected by edges

**Cycle**: Path that starts and ends at same vertex

**Connected**: Path exists between any two vertices

**Tree**: Connected graph with no cycles

### Graph Representations

**Adjacency List**:
```
Graph:
  1 → [2, 3]
  2 → [1, 4]
  3 → [1]
  4 → [2]
```

**Adjacency Matrix**:
```
    1  2  3  4
1 [ 0  1  1  0 ]
2 [ 1  0  0  1 ]
3 [ 1  0  0  0 ]
4 [ 0  1  0  0 ]
```

## Combinatorics

### Permutations

**Permutation**: Arrangement of objects

**Formula**: P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!

**Example**: Arrange 3 books from 5
```
P(5, 3) = 5! / (5-3)! = 5! / 2! = 60
```

### Combinations

**Combination**: Selection of objects (order doesn't matter)

**Formula**: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

**Example**: Choose 3 books from 5
```
C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! × 2!) = 10
```

### Binomial Theorem

**Formula**: (x + y)ⁿ = Σ C(n, k) xᵏ yⁿ⁻ᵏ

**Example**: (x + y)³
```
= C(3,0)x³y⁰ + C(3,1)x²y¹ + C(3,2)x¹y² + C(3,3)x⁰y³
= x³ + 3x²y + 3xy² + y³
```

## Proof Techniques

### Direct Proof

**Method**: Assume P, prove Q

**Example**: Prove "If n is even, then n² is even"
```
Assume n is even: n = 2k
Then n² = (2k)² = 4k² = 2(2k²)
Therefore n² is even
```

### Proof by Contradiction

**Method**: Assume ¬P, derive contradiction

**Example**: Prove "√2 is irrational"
```
Assume √2 is rational: √2 = a/b (simplified)
Then 2 = a²/b², so 2b² = a²
Therefore a² is even, so a is even: a = 2k
Then 2b² = (2k)² = 4k², so b² = 2k²
Therefore b² is even, so b is even
But a and b both even contradicts a/b simplified
Therefore √2 is irrational
```

### Proof by Induction

**Method**: 
1. Base case: Prove P(1)
2. Inductive step: Prove P(k) → P(k+1)

**Example**: Prove 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2
```
Base case (n=1): 1 = 1(1+1)/2 = 1 ✓

Inductive step:
Assume: 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2
Prove: 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2

1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1)
= k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)
= (k+1)(k/2 + 1)
= (k+1)(k+2)/2 ✓
```

## Number Theory Basics

### Divisibility

**Definition**: a divides b (a | b) if b = ak for some k

**Properties**:
- If a | b and b | c, then a | c
- If a | b and a | c, then a | (b + c)

### Prime Numbers

**Prime**: Number > 1 with only divisors 1 and itself

**Fundamental Theorem**: Every integer > 1 can be uniquely factored into primes

**Example**: 60 = 2² × 3 × 5

### GCD & LCM

**GCD** (Greatest Common Divisor):
```
gcd(48, 18) = 6
```

**LCM** (Least Common Multiple):
```
lcm(48, 18) = 144
```

**Euclidean Algorithm**:
```
gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b)

Example:
gcd(48, 18)
= gcd(18, 48 mod 18) = gcd(18, 12)
= gcd(12, 18 mod 12) = gcd(12, 6)
= gcd(6, 12 mod 6) = gcd(6, 0)
= 6
```

### Modular Arithmetic

**Definition**: a ≡ b (mod n) if n | (a - b)

**Properties**:
```
(a + b) mod n = ((a mod n) + (b mod n)) mod n
(a × b) mod n = ((a mod n) × (b mod n)) mod n
```

**Example**:
```
17 mod 5 = 2
(17 + 8) mod 5 = (2 + 3) mod 5 = 0
```

## Real-World Applications

### Example 1: Hash Tables

**Sets**: Used to represent hash table buckets

**Functions**: Hash function maps keys to buckets

**Combinatorics**: Analyze collision probability

### Example 2: Graph Algorithms

**Graphs**: Model networks, relationships

**Algorithms**: Shortest path, minimum spanning tree

**Applications**: Social networks, routing, scheduling

### Example 3: Cryptography

**Number Theory**: RSA encryption uses prime factorization

**Modular Arithmetic**: Used in encryption algorithms

**Combinatorics**: Analyze key space size

## Common Pitfalls

### Problem: Confusing Permutations and Combinations

```c
// BAD: Use permutation when combination needed
// Choosing 3 people from 5 for committee
P(5, 3) = 60 // Wrong! Order doesn't matter

// GOOD: Use combination
C(5, 3) = 10 // Correct
```

### Problem: Incorrect Set Operations

```c
// BAD: Confusing union and intersection
A ∪ B // All elements in A or B
A ∩ B // Elements in both A and B

// GOOD: Understand difference
```

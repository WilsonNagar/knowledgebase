## Probability Basics

### What is Probability?

**Probability**: Measure of likelihood

**Range**: 0 to 1

**0**: Impossible event

**1**: Certain event

**0.5**: Equally likely

### Sample Space & Events

**Sample Space (S)**: Set of all possible outcomes

**Event (E)**: Subset of sample space

**Example**: Rolling die
```
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
E = {2, 4, 6} (even numbers)
```

### Probability Axioms

**1. Non-negativity**: P(E) ≥ 0

**2. Normalization**: P(S) = 1

**3. Additivity**: P(E₁ ∪ E₂) = P(E₁) + P(E₂) if E₁ ∩ E₂ = ∅

### Probability Rules

**Complement**: P(E') = 1 - P(E)

**Union**: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

**Intersection**: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) if A and B independent

## Conditional Probability

### Definition

**Conditional Probability**: P(A|B)

**Meaning**: Probability of A given B occurred

**Formula**: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

### Example

**Scenario**: Drawing cards

**P(Heart | Red)**:
```
P(Red) = 26/52 = 1/2
P(Heart and Red) = 13/52 = 1/4
P(Heart | Red) = (1/4) / (1/2) = 1/2
```

### Independence

**Independent Events**: P(A|B) = P(A)

**Meaning**: B doesn't affect A

**Formula**: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

## Random Variables

### What is a Random Variable?

**Random Variable**: Function from sample space to real numbers

**Types**:
- **Discrete**: Countable outcomes
- **Continuous**: Uncountable outcomes

### Discrete Random Variable

**Example**: Number of heads in 3 coin flips

**Values**: 0, 1, 2, 3

**Probability Mass Function (PMF)**:
```
P(X = 0) = 1/8
P(X = 1) = 3/8
P(X = 2) = 3/8
P(X = 3) = 1/8
```

### Continuous Random Variable

**Example**: Height of person

**Values**: Any real number in range

**Probability Density Function (PDF)**:
```
f(x) = probability density at x
P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫[a to b] f(x) dx
```

## Probability Distributions

### Discrete Distributions

**1. Uniform**:
```
All outcomes equally likely
P(X = k) = 1/n for k = 1, 2, ..., n
```

**2. Bernoulli**:
```
Two outcomes: success (p) or failure (1-p)
P(X = 1) = p, P(X = 0) = 1-p
```

**3. Binomial**:
```
n independent Bernoulli trials
P(X = k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)
```

**4. Poisson**:
```
Rare events
P(X = k) = (λ^k × e^(-λ)) / k!
```

### Continuous Distributions

**1. Uniform**:
```
Constant probability over range
f(x) = 1/(b-a) for a ≤ x ≤ b
```

**2. Normal (Gaussian)**:
```
Bell curve
f(x) = (1/(σ√(2π))) × e^(-(x-μ)²/(2σ²))
```

**3. Exponential**:
```
Time between events
f(x) = λe^(-λx) for x ≥ 0
```

## Expected Value & Variance

### Expected Value

**Definition**: E[X] = Σ x × P(X = x) (discrete)

**E[X] = ∫ x × f(x) dx** (continuous)

**Meaning**: Average value

**Properties**:
- **Linearity**: E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b
- **Sum**: E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]

### Variance

**Definition**: Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])²]

**Formula**: Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])²

**Meaning**: Measure of spread

**Standard Deviation**: σ = √Var(X)

### Example

**Bernoulli Distribution**:
```
E[X] = p
Var(X) = p(1-p)
```

**Binomial Distribution**:
```
E[X] = np
Var(X) = np(1-p)
```

## Statistical Measures

### Mean

**Sample Mean**: x̄ = (1/n) Σ xᵢ

**Population Mean**: μ = E[X]

**Use**: Central tendency

### Median

**Definition**: Middle value when sorted

**Use**: Robust to outliers

### Mode

**Definition**: Most frequent value

**Use**: Most common value

### Measures of Spread

**1. Variance**: Average squared deviation

**2. Standard Deviation**: √Variance

**3. Range**: Max - Min

**4. Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Q3 - Q1

## Hypothesis Testing

### What is Hypothesis Testing?

**Purpose**: Test claims about population

**Process**:
```
1. State null hypothesis (H₀)
2. State alternative hypothesis (H₁)
3. Collect data
4. Calculate test statistic
5. Determine p-value
6. Make decision
```

### P-Value

**Definition**: Probability of observing data as extreme or more extreme

**Interpretation**:
- **Small p-value**: Evidence against H₀
- **Large p-value**: No evidence against H₀

**Threshold**: Typically α = 0.05

### Type I & Type II Errors

**Type I Error**: Reject H₀ when true (false positive)

**Type II Error**: Accept H₀ when false (false negative)

**Significance Level (α)**: Probability of Type I error

**Power**: 1 - P(Type II error)

## Bayes' Theorem

### Bayes' Theorem

**Formula**: P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B)

**Components**:
- **P(A|B)**: Posterior probability
- **P(B|A)**: Likelihood
- **P(A)**: Prior probability
- **P(B)**: Evidence

### Bayes' Theorem Example

**Scenario**: Medical test

**Given**:
- **Disease prevalence**: P(D) = 0.01
- **Test sensitivity**: P(T|D) = 0.99
- **Test specificity**: P(¬T|¬D) = 0.95

**Question**: P(D|T) = ?

**Solution**:
```
P(D|T) = P(T|D) × P(D) / P(T)
P(T) = P(T|D)×P(D) + P(T|¬D)×P(¬D)
     = 0.99×0.01 + 0.05×0.99 = 0.0594
P(D|T) = 0.99 × 0.01 / 0.0594 ≈ 0.167
```

**Interpretation**: Even with positive test, only 16.7% chance of disease

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Load Balancing

**Problem**: Distribute requests across servers

**Solution**: Random selection

**Probability**: Each server selected with equal probability

**Expected load**: Uniform distribution

### Example 2: Hash Collisions

**Problem**: Probability of hash collision

**Birthday Paradox**: 
```
With n items and m buckets:
  P(collision) ≈ 1 - e^(-n²/(2m))
```

**Example**: 23 people, 365 days → ~50% chance of shared birthday

### Example 3: Randomized Algorithms

**Problem**: Find element in array

**Randomized Algorithm**: Randomly check elements

**Expected checks**: O(n) worst case, but may find quickly

## Common Pitfalls

### Problem: Confusing Correlation and Causation

```c
// BAD: Assume correlation implies causation
// Ice cream sales correlate with drowning
// But ice cream doesn't cause drowning!

// GOOD: Understand correlation ≠ causation
// Both may be caused by third factor (summer)
```

### Problem: Misinterpreting P-Values

```c
// BAD: P-value = probability H₀ is true
// P-value = probability of data given H₀

// GOOD: Understand what p-value means
// Small p-value: Unlikely to observe data if H₀ true
```

# System Design Principles

## Overview

System design principles guide the architecture of large-scale systems. This guide covers design principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS), trade-offs, non-functional requirements, capacity planning, and designing systems for scale, reliability, and maintainability.

## Deep Explanation

### Design Principles

**SOLID**: Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion
**DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
**KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid
**YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**: Response time, throughput
**Scalability**: Handle growth
**Reliability**: Uptime, fault tolerance
**Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption
**Maintainability**: Code quality, documentation

### Capacity Planning

**Load Estimation**: Expected traffic
**Resource Planning**: CPU, memory, storage
**Scaling Strategy**: When and how to scale

## Real Code Examples

### Example: System Design Process

1. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional
2. **Scale Estimation**: Users, requests, data
3. **API Design**: Endpoints, data models
4. **Database Design**: Schema, sharding
5. **Component Design**: Services, interactions
6. **Scaling**: Horizontal, caching, CDN

## Hard Use-Case: Designing a URL Shortener

### Problem Statement

Design a URL shortener like bit.ly handling 100M URLs and 100M requests/day.

### Solution

**Components**:
- API servers
- Database (sharded)
- Cache (Redis)
- Load balancer
- CDN

**Key Decisions**:
- Base62 encoding for short URLs
- Database sharding by hash
- Cache popular URLs
- CDN for static assets

## Quiz

### Question 1
What does SOLID stand for in system design?

**A)** Simple, Optimized, Logical, Integrated, Dynamic  
**B)** Single Responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion  
**C)** Scalable, Optimized, Logical, Integrated, Distributed  
**D)** Secure, Optimized, Logical, Integrated, Dynamic

**Answer: B** - SOLID represents five object-oriented design principles.

# Performance Optimization

## Overview

Performance optimization improves system efficiency and response times. This guide covers profiling techniques, bottleneck identification, database optimization, query optimization, caching strategies, and achieving sub-millisecond response times.

## Deep Explanation

### Optimization Process

**Measure**: Profile and benchmark
**Identify**: Find bottlenecks
**Optimize**: Fix issues
**Verify**: Measure improvements

### Common Bottlenecks

**Database**: Slow queries, N+1 problems
**Network**: Latency, bandwidth
**CPU**: Inefficient algorithms
**Memory**: Leaks, inefficient usage

### Optimization Techniques

**Database**: Indexes, query optimization, connection pooling
**Caching**: Multi-level caching, cache warming
**Code**: Algorithm optimization, async processing

## Real Code Examples

### Example: Query Optimization

**Before**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM users WHERE status = 'active'
);
```

**After**:
```sql
SELECT o.* FROM orders o
INNER JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.status = 'active';
```

### Question 1
What is the first step in performance optimization?

**A)** Optimize code  
**B)** Add caching  
**C)** Measure and profile  
**D)** Scale horizontally

**Answer: C** - Always measure and profile first to identify actual bottlenecks before optimizing.

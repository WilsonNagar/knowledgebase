# Load Balancing Strategies

## Overview

Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple servers. This guide covers load balancing algorithms, health checks, session persistence, geographic load balancing, and building highly available systems.

## Deep Explanation

### Algorithms

**Round Robin**: Distribute sequentially
**Least Connections**: Send to least busy server
**IP Hash**: Route by client IP
**Weighted**: Assign weights to servers

### Health Checks

**Active**: Proactively check servers
**Passive**: Monitor responses
**Graceful Degradation**: Remove unhealthy servers

## Real Code Examples

### Example: Health Check Configuration

```nginx
upstream backend {
    least_conn;
    server backend1:8080 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    server backend2:8080 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    server backend3:8080 backup;  # Backup server
}
```

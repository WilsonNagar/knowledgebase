# Microservices Architecture

## Overview

Microservices architecture breaks applications into small, independent services. This guide covers service decomposition, API gateways, service discovery, inter-service communication, data management, and building scalable microservices systems.

## Deep Explanation

### Principles

**Single Responsibility**: One service, one purpose
**Independence**: Deploy independently
**Decentralized**: Own data and logic
**Failure Isolation**: Failures don't cascade

### Communication Patterns

**Synchronous**: REST, gRPC
**Asynchronous**: Message queues, events
**API Gateway**: Single entry point

### Data Management

**Database per Service**: Each service has its own database
**Eventual Consistency**: Accept temporary inconsistency
**Saga Pattern**: Distributed transactions

## Real Code Examples

### Example: Service Decomposition

```
Monolith:
├── User Management
├── Order Processing
├── Payment Processing
└── Inventory Management

Microservices:
├── User Service (PostgreSQL)
├── Order Service (MongoDB)
├── Payment Service (PostgreSQL)
└── Inventory Service (Redis)
```

## Quiz

### Question 1
What is the recommended database pattern for microservices?

**A)** Shared database  
**B)** Database per service  
**C)** Single database  
**D)** No database

**Answer: B** - Each microservice should have its own database for independence.

# Event-Driven Architecture

## Overview

Event-driven architecture is a design pattern where services communicate through events. This guide covers event sourcing, CQRS, event streaming, event choreography vs orchestration, saga patterns, and building scalable event-driven systems.

## Deep Explanation

### Event-Driven Patterns

**Event Sourcing**: Store all state changes as events
**CQRS**: Separate read and write models
**Event Streaming**: Continuous event processing
**Pub/Sub**: Publish-subscribe messaging

### Event Types

**Domain Events**: Business events
**Integration Events**: Cross-service events
**System Events**: Infrastructure events

### Benefits

- Loose coupling
- Scalability
- Resilience
- Real-time processing

## Real Code Examples

### Example: Event Sourcing

```python
# Event store
events = [
    {"type": "UserCreated", "data": {"id": 1, "name": "John"}},
    {"type": "UserUpdated", "data": {"id": 1, "name": "John Updated"}},
]

# Rebuild state
def rebuild_state(events):
    state = {}
    for event in events:
        if event["type"] == "UserCreated":
            state[event["data"]["id"]] = event["data"]
        elif event["type"] == "UserUpdated":
            state[event["data"]["id"]].update(event["data"])
    return state
```

## Hard Use-Case: Distributed Saga Pattern

### Problem Statement

Implement a distributed transaction across multiple services using the saga pattern.

### Solution

**Choreography**:
- Each service publishes events
- Services react to events
- No central coordinator

**Orchestration**:
- Central orchestrator
- Coordinates steps
- Manages compensation

# CI/CD Pipeline Design

## Overview

CI/CD pipelines automate software delivery. This guide covers pipeline design, testing strategies, deployment strategies (blue-green, canary), rollback procedures, and building production-ready CI/CD systems.

## Deep Explanation

### Pipeline Stages

**Build**: Compile code
**Test**: Run tests
**Deploy**: Deploy to environments
**Monitor**: Verify deployment

### Deployment Strategies

**Blue-Green**: Switch between environments
**Canary**: Gradual rollout
**Rolling**: Update instances gradually

## Real Code Examples

### Example: Multi-Stage Pipeline

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy-staging
  - deploy-production

build:
  script:
    - docker build -t app:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
  
test:
  script:
    - docker run app:$CI_COMMIT_SHA npm test
  
deploy-staging:
  script:
    - kubectl set image deployment/app app=app:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  environment:
    name: staging
  
deploy-production:
  script:
    - kubectl set image deployment/app app=app:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  environment:
    name: production
  when: manual
```

## Quiz

### Question 1
What is the advantage of canary deployment?

**A)** Faster deployment  
**B)** Gradual rollout with risk mitigation  
**C)** Simpler setup  
**D)** Lower costs

**Answer: B** - Canary deployment allows gradual rollout with ability to quickly rollback if issues are detected.
